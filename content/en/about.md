__Adno is a web application for viewing, editing, and sharing peer-to-peer of narratives and stories on IIIF images.__ 

Developed by [Espace Mendès France](https://emf.fr) (Poitiers), in partnership with the [Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe abbey and the valley of frescoes](https://www.abbaye-saint-savin.fr/), the [Sainte-Geneviève Library](https://www.bsg.univ-paris3.fr/iguana/www.main.cls) (Paris), the [Cité internationale de la bande-dessinée et de l’image](http://www.citebd.org/) (Angoulême), [Poitiers’ museums](https://www.poitiers.fr/c__231_977__accueil_musee_sainte_croix.html), La [Rochelle’s Natural History Museum](https://museum.larochelle.fr/), Adno was selected among the sixteen winners of the 2022 edition of the [call for innovative digital services projects](https://www.culture.gouv.fr/Presse/Communiques-de-presse/Resultats-de-l-appel-a-projets-Services-numeriques-innovants-2022) led by the Ministry of Culture..

## Adno’s origin

A cultural actor who wishes to put his image collections online is faced with complex choices. The solutions are too often expensive, not very scalable and, above all, incompatible with each other, even though they attempt to meet common needs.

[IIIF](https://iiif.io) was created after noticing that images sharing on the web was « too slow, too expensive, too disjoint and too complex ». It was launched in 2015 by the British Library, France National Library, Die Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Nasjonalbiblioteket, Artstor, Wellcome Trust, and the following universities : Cornell, Oxford, Princeton, Stanford et Yale. The consortium gathers today around sixty research libraries, national libraries, archives, socities and aggregator from all round the world. Many professionals and amators are also contributing to the dynamism of the community. 

[IIIF](https://iiif.io) became the generic and standardized technical frame for the diffusion of high-quality images and their metadata. [IIIF](https://iiif.io) enables the accessibility, consultation, comparison, edition, « citation », annotation, and remixing of thoses images by any compatible application able to connect to the different depots. Hundreds of millions of resources – works and documents’ reproduction, pictures, drawings, comic strips, maps, plans, charts – are thus displayed. This protocol is also available for audio, video and 3D documents. 

If IIIF server and viewers are well-known and developped, tools for simple users are still experimental and often non-free. Some software are particularly interesting to edit and share IIIF resources :

- [Storiiies](https://storiiies.cogapp.com/) – a well-designed and open access tool, but a proprietary one.
- [Panel Truck](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/documentation/panel-truck.html) – an open acess software which requires code editing.
- [Exhibit](https://www.exhibit.so/) – a service initiated during the COVID-19 crisis in order to guarantee the education continuity of an university.
- [Tesselle](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/outils/tesselle/) – an open access tool developped by the Media Lab of SciencesPo (Paris), with a very ergonomic design, but which doesn’t support IIIF.

By combining a viewer and a editor, Adno tries to overtake limits of what already exists and brings an accessible and user-friendly solution to researchers, artists, teachers, cultural mediators and scientifics. Adno aims to develop new creative and educational usages.

## Description

Adno allows the user to explore a work or a document in its whole or by its details, to share some knowledge, to narrate stories, to draw or to tag, and so on, and, in practice, to read and write annotations and to share them easily. 

Adno is a web application, easy and ergonomic, which enables to view, edit and share annotated IIIF images. You can either enter a IIIF image (by itself or from a manifest) or a list of annotations (W3C or IIIF). The application produces an organized list of annotations. 

An annotations asociates textual or multimedia informations to an area. Adno has the following features :

- __server side__ : easy setting up (static files), no distribution or recording of any content, no collection of personal data.
- __client side__ : processing, storage, diffusion are operated by the browser, the application is usable on a computer, digital tablet, touchscreen table.

The InterPlanetary File System (IFPS) is the protocol used by Adno to share the annotations. IFPS is a pear-to-pair share system of files addressable by hypermedia. This allows to stock and share files or folders in a decentralized and durable manner, and to acess them via an IFPS identifier or a classic http URL. 

Adno is based on open standard and free component. It has been develeopped in an agile way, observing good customs (code, tests, documentation, accessibility, and so on). It is an online service (adno.app), an autonomous software and a naturally incorporable in the Web3 technologies component : semantic web, artificial intelligence, blochain, and so on. 

By its nature, IIIF and IFPS protocols help to limit energy consumption. Annotations lists are textual and therefore very light, the images are only listed there. Finally, only the needed images’ parts are downloaded. 

Adno facilitates the diffusion and visibility of cultural contents and contributes to the improvement of technical means, which allows interoperability and reuse, in line with the « Data and cultural contents » roadmap from the Ministry. 

## Innovative aspect

IIIF offers simplified and uniform access to advanced document interaction features: fluid and enriched image exploration (deep zoom, rotation, etc.), multi-layer and multi-spectral visualization, area comparison and annotation, etc.

Adno is a common tool for digital humanities, education, research and creation. It makes affordable and popular two innovative and promising technologies: IIIF and IPFS. These fundamentally decentralized and collaborative approaches realize the potential of the semantic web and foreshadow the distributed web.

Adno opens up numerous perspectives: support for audio, video and 3D objects, collaborative editing, participatory production (crowdsourcing), development of modules for specialized software for digital libraries or publishing, connection with pattern recognition devices (AI), etc.

## Shareable and replicable aspect

Adno is freely usable on [adno.app](https://emf.fr). The sources as well as the documentation are published under free licenses. They can be downloaded from open software forges. Adno can therefore be installed and adapted without any restriction.

## Version

First release awaited for the start of october 2022.
